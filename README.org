#+title: My Dotfiles Website in Org Mode

* Overview

This is a test of use *org mode* for create a _website_ for save my dotfiles. You can see the website [[https://regalk13.github.io/dotfiles-website/][here.]]

* How it works

I use a simple package to compile from org-mode to HTML named html-size and using a css public for org-mode, you can see more in build-site.el in the source code. After I use the emacs elips interpreter to compile the website
and whit github actions the deploy is up and online!

* The dotfiles

The purpose of this website is save and publish my dotfiles, but first I will have to update and change them to org-mode.
